Manual coding is arcane. Ai can do in a minute what 10 "expert" coders can do in a week. 

Rust is objectively the god lang ... at leat till Ai poops out something superior. 

@LaurieWired is the only good tech person on youtube.

Php and Go are mind viruses. The easy way is touted as the best way. That is silly. The easy way is the LAZY way, and ther are no true shortcuts in life.  With Ai, there is no excuse to not use Rust. 

BEFORE Ai, GO was super cool. After Ai, people who know Go try to hype its value. So many pro Go youtubers hype Go all day long-, then complain about how people say the like Rust so much. Rust is superior, Go is easy but having Ai code Rust apps for you is MORE easy.  Go is for lazy people. Go is going out of style, fast! 

Zig, the "nonprofit" is just another money laundering scam. MOST nonprofits are a huge scam. Having a 4 person "team" make financial gain is NOT how to properly run a lang. It is more like a crypto-coin/DAO/NFT scam. As such, zig leadership is laughable. They CLAIM they are not out for financial gain, and yet beg for money every so often. Utterly laughable scam. Get rid of the entire Zig leadership con artists and Zig would start to take off. 

The combo of Quantum Computing together with Ai is interesting. Someone should look into that lol .
